- A call to Config::SetupFonbookIDs now deletes a previously instantiated FonbookManager
  to allow multiple calls to SetupFonbookIDs in case of configuration changes.

2008-12-28:
- Made Listener a singleton. A call to Listener::CreateListener() is used to activate this feature.
- Introduced new method CallList::CreateCallList() to explicitly pre-fetch the call list before
  calling CallList::getCallList().
- Moved Config::SetupFonbookIDs to FonbookManager::CreateFonbookManager().

2009-02-23:
- added exception catch in Tools::GetLang() and Tools::Login()

2009-03-27:
- Removed the default of countryCode = "49" if Tools::GetLocationSettings() fails. This task is 
  handed over to the caller, see next.
- Added new parameters to Config::Setup() to give default values for countryCode and regionCode.
  The default parameters are used, when auto-detection in Tools::GetLocationSettings() fails. The
  new parameter locationSettingsDetected indicates whether auto-detection was successful. In this
  case, the given default values are overwritten to give the caller access to the new values.
