  avoiding the delay in the menu; to keep it up to date, it is
  reloaded after every call automatically
- new makefile target "srcdoc" to generate source code documentation
- Improved the 'i18n' target in the Makefile to avoid unnecessary work as suggested by

  (thanks to Reinhard [11] for the hint to this option) 
- now normalizing number when doing a lookup to dasoertliche.de
  (reported by Reinhard [11])

2008-03-02: Version 0.0.12

  Fritz!Box correctly. If no LKZ is set, 49 is assumed.
- extended cFritzListener to handle multiple lines in one message
- corrected some dsyslog() calls missing the sourcecode filename
> If no serious bugs appear with this release, it will get the stable plugin 
  release 1.0.0 for VDR 1.6. Translation contributions (.po-files) are appreciated.
  
2008-04-13:  Version 1.0.0

2008-07-17: Version 1.1.0
- started new development branch (copy from version 1.0.1)
  This branch is for development use and curious users only. If you like
  a stable and reliable environment, please use the stable branch 1.0.x.
  Distribution maintainers: Please take actions to prevent users from
  accidentially upgrading from a stable 1.0.x version to this branch.

  incoming, outgoing or any calls
- normalizing outgoing numbers for fonbook lookups, etc. now includes
  * removing an appended '#' (includes displaying)
  * removing German call-by-call provider selection codes
- implemented support for a local phone book (suggested by neptunvasja [6])
  * The fonbook is a csv-file located at 
    $vdrconfigdir/plugins/fritzbox/localfonbuch.csv
    using the same encoding as VDR
  * Each line of this file has the pattern 
    <name>,<type>,<number>
    For <type> specify 1 (home), 2 (mobile) or 3 (work).
- changed function of kRed in the menu
  * "Reload phonebooks" was moved to the setup menu
  * new function "Next phonebook" ("> PB") iterates through
    the displayable phonebooks 
    (the last one shown is remembered beyond vdr restarts)

  If switched to yes, the plugin opens an own OSD screen for notifications
  instead of using Skins.Message. This way, more information can be displayed 
  (still to be done).

  ressources should follow this naming scheme.
  (based on a bug report of ronnykornexl [30])
- fixed dasoertliche.de fonbuch by adding a user-agent to the http request, which
  is required by the webserver recently  
- fixed possible segfault when pressing OK in empty fonbuch menu
  (reported by ronnykornexl [30])
- made LKZ/OKZ parsing more robust against wrong password
- added support for phone books without number-type (e.g., old Fritz!Boxes) in 
  phone book detail screen
  (reported by ronnykornexl [30])
- fixed possible segfault on invalid data in fritzbox.Fonbooks setup parameter
- fixed storing the password, which got lost in some cases
- changed default password to an empty one

- fixed compiler warning wrt comparison in cNotifyOsd
- updated italian translations (provided by Diego [24])
- implemented reverse lookup function for +31 (Netherlands)
- adapting plugin to new Fritz!Box firmware versions: 
  * auto detecting charset encoding when retrieving phonebook entries
  * modified interface language detection (currently using a trial-and-error approach, 
    because old approach is no longer supported by newest firmware)
- splitted plugin into plugin application and three static libraries
  * libfritz++ (included all Fritz!Box specific functionality)
  * libtcpclient++ (providing tcp socket communication)
  * libpthread++ (providing pthread support, independant of VDRs implementation)  
  With this, it is possible to use these libraries in other projects not related to VDR.
- all socket communication of the plugin can now be traced into /tmp/tcpclient.trace.
  If this file exists at VDR startup, tracing is enabled. If not, tracing is disabled.
  If you experience problems with vdr-fritzbox, this trace may be helpful in debugging 
  the issue. However, please be aware that this trace may contain password and other 
  sensitive information.
- modified logging to syslog. All log entries related to this plugin are now 
  prefixed with "vdr-fritzbox:".  
- removed memory leak in cMenuSetupFritzbox::Store[MSN|Fonbooks]
- fixed some compiler warnings that occur with recent compiler versions (4.3.x)
- fixed missing includes which prevented compilation with recent compiler versions (4.3.x)

2008-12-31: Version 1.1.4
- adapted to changes in libfritz++:
  * Added type "ALL" to CallList to retrieve complete list of calls at once.
  * Moved callType from CallList to CallEntry. 
  * Implemented in-library msn filtering and reverse-lookups.
  * Renamed various methods in FonbookManager from *Fonbuch* to *Fonbook*.
  * Made CallList a singleton.
  * Replaced string tokenizer in Listener.
  * Refactored MSN-filter functionality.
  * Added "-fPIC" to Makefiles.
  * A call to Config::SetupFonbookIDs now deletes a previously instantiated FonbookManager
    to allow multiple calls to SetupFonbookIDs in case of configuration changes.
  * Introduced new method CallList::DeleteCallList() to explicitly delete the singleton instance.
  * Made Listener a singleton. A call to Listener::CreateListener() is used to activate this feature.
  * Introduced new method CallList::CreateCallList() to explicitly pre-fetch the call list before
    calling CallList::getCallList().
  * Moved Config::SetupFonbookIDs to FonbookManager::CreateFonbookManager().
  * Renamed Tools::GetPhoneSettings() to Tools::GetLocationSettings().
  * Added resolving of SIP[0-9] to real provider names.
- configuration changes of MSN filter, selected fonbooks, hostname and password are now 
  considered immediately without a restart
- plugin classes no longer hold own references to fonbook, listener and callList. They now use the
  static getter methods.
- fixed a possible crash when using the plugin with showNumber = pauseOnCall = muteOnCall = false.
  (patch provided by Andreas [26])
- using new library feature: resolving SIP provider names, instead of signalling SIP0, ...

2009-03-14: Version 1.1.5
- changes in libfritz++
  * added exception catch in Tools::GetLang() and Tools::Login()
- changes in libpthread++
  * added missing include in PThread++.h to fix compiler issue with g++-3.3
  
2009-05-12: Version 1.1.6
- changes in libfritz++
  * Removed the default of countryCode = "49" if Tools::GetLocationSettings() fails. This task is 
  handed over to the caller, see next.
  * Added new parameters to Config::Setup() to give default values for countryCode and regionCode.
  The default parameters are used, when auto-detection in Tools::GetLocationSettings() fails. The
  new parameter locationSettingsDetected indicates whether auto-detection was successful. In this
  case, the given default values are overwritten to give the caller access to the new values.
  * Fixed naming of local phonebook. The recommended name is now localphonebook.csv, the old name 
  localfonbuch.csv is still accepted. The directory remains $vdrconfigdir/plugins/fritzbox/.
- added new setup options for country code and region code. If the plugin is unable to detect 
  these automatically (e.g., with some older Fritz!Boxes) the values are taken from these setup
  options.
  (reported by Ronny [30])

2009-05-28: Version 1.2.0 
- updated italian translations (provided by Diego [24])
- changes in libfritz++
  * Updated OertlichesFonbook to new website layout 
  (fix provided by Matthias [31])
  
2009-08-27: Version 1.3.0.
- fixed naming of local phonebook. The plugin now really looks for a file called 
  localphonebook.csv.
  (reported by Tobias [1])
- fixed missing translation of phonebooks in cMenuSetupFritzboxFonbooks
- fixed missing translation of phonebook entries with type TYPE_NONE 
- first implementation to add call list entries to active phonebook.
- now saving status of last known missed calls as soon as possible to avoid data loss
  if VDR does not shutdown cleanly (suggested by Keine_Ahnung [32])
- moved plugin initialization from cPluginFritzbox::Start() into a separated thread
  to speed up VDR startup when expecting slow network links
- changes in libfritz++
  * Implemented new login method for Fritz!Box firmware >= xx.04.74 using SIDs. This needs 
    features from openssl library. For compiling, libssl-dev (or similar) is needed.
  * Fixed a warning warn_unused_result in LocalFonbook.cpp
  * Fixed wrong HTTP-GET header in Nummerzoeker.cpp
- adapting Makefile to support new features of libfritz++: 
  Libssl is now needed to compile and/or run the plugin.
  
2009-11-21: Version 1.3.1
- changes in libfritz++
  * fixed detection of login failure in Tools::Login()
  * improved cleanup when deleting Listener, FritzFonbook, CallList
  * delay destructor of FritzFonbook and CallList to wait for running threads to end
  * improved concurrent access to Fritz!Box using new FritzClient class
  * fixed entity decoding in FritzFonbook.cpp (reported and fix tested by Torsten [17])
  * improved detection of login type (SID or PASSWORD), which is now done only once
  * improved login to Fritz!Box to avoid unneccessary logins
  * fixed TcpClient to throw correct exceptions on connect
    this fixes detection of disabled call monitor, the corresponding hint "dial #96*5*" 
    is now shown in syslog again  
  * improved matching of phone numbers: Fritz!Box control codes *xxx# are now ignored.
    (suggested by koronth [34])
- added configuration option to choose default screen when calling the plugins' main 
  menu action.
- fixed a possible crash when changing the plugins setup
- improved responsiveness when storing the plugins setup
- both detail screens (call details and phonebook entry details) can now be closed with
  OK button, too
  (patch provided by Uwe [33]) 

2010-01-02: Version 1.3.2
- changes in libfritz++
  * added missing include <cstring> in FritzClient.cpp
    (patch provided by hotzenplotz5 [35])
  * fixed retry delay calculation in case of connection refused
  * simplified implementation of connection disconnect
    this possibly fixes a crash when changing the plugins setup with FB call monitor disabled
    (reported by Frank [36])
- updated italian translations (provided by Diego [24])

2010-05-30: Version 1.3.3
- changes in libfritz++ and libtcpclient++
  * Fixed missing initialization of HttpClientBuf::state
  * Improved thread safety in TcpClient: 
    deleting TcpClient while reading from stream in another thread caused memory corruption
  * Improved destructor of Listener to allow proper cleanup of thread
  * Fixed some warnings about ununsed parameters in base-classes and empty implementations
  * removed FonbookEntry::getTypeName() as this is something the consumer has to take care about
  * introduced I18N_NOOP macro, this allows application that use libfritz++ to identify strings 
    delivered by the library (e.g., using xgettext) they should localize
  * removed dependency to OpenSSL due to licensing issues, libfritz++ now needs libgcrypt's 
    development header "gcrypt.h" to compile
  * modified logging to handle full path filenames cause by cmake in __FILE__.
    Provided new logging macros DBG, INF, ERR
  * Fixed a possible issue with "thread-safety" of TcpClient, a TcpClient object can now 
    be deleted out of another thread while running
- the changes in libfritz++ and libtcpclient++ should improve overall plugin stability
  especially at shutdown and configuration changes (thx to Torsten [17] and Marcus [21] for testing)
- removed some translation hints which are now provided by libfritz++ directly
- implemented cPluginFritzbox::FonbookEntryToName to adapt to changes in libfritz++
- linking to libgcrypt instead of openssl now because of licensing issues
- adapted logging to libfritz++
- adapted Makefile to VDR >= 1.7.13 

2010-07-04: Version 1.3.4
- changes in libfritz++ 
  * now parsing the Fritz Box's phone book via xml export file (if available)
  * FritzFonbook is now writeable, if FB xml import is available 
    (firmware >= xx.04.76 needed)
  * phone book entries now have the additional fields "quickdial", "vanity", 
    "priority", "important"
  * Fixed decoding of entities in xml phone book parser
  * Modified FonbookEntry class: one FonbookEntry now holds all numbers of a 
    person: Changed construction of FonbookEntrys accordingly, Changed interface 
    of Fonbook::ResolveToName, Adapted FritzFonbook's parser, Adapted LocalFonbook's parser,
    Adapted ResolveToName in NummerzoekerFonbook and OertlichesFonbook
  * Adapted local phonebook to use the same xml format, new FB versions use.
    Existing csv phone books are converted to xml automagically, entries 
    with TYPE_NONE are converted to TYPE_HOME
  * Updated OertlichesFonbook to website changes
    (patch provided by [38])
- adapted to changes in libfritz++
  Note: not all new features of libfritz++ are currently used in the plugin
- added setup option "Resume after call"
  Up to now the setup option "Pause on call" included both, stopping *and* resuming playback on the 
  corresponding call events. This has been splitted now. "Pause on call" now only controls playback
  stopping. "Resume after call" controls, if VDR resumes a previously stopped playback after all
  calls have been finished. The old behaviour is preserved on upgrade.
  (suggested by Zimbo [37])

2010-07-29: Version 1.3.5
- changes in libfritz++
  * Fixed resolving of calls from unknown caller
    (reported by Honky 	[39]

    logged by default.
    (suggested by C-3PO [41])
  * Moved from libpthread++ to libccgnu2
  * First steps in migrating to socket implementation of common c++
    -> To compile vdr-fritz, development header files of the gnu common c++ library 
    are needed!
  * Splitted Config::Setup into Config::Setup and Config::Init
  * Fix reverse lookup in OertlichesFonbook
    (patch provided by Kurt Wanner [43])
  * Add missing include to XmlFonbook
    (reported by Richard Bos [42])
- The new command line option --log-personal-info re-enables logging all information  
  (Suggested by C-3PO [41])
- Migration to gnu common c++ library should fix a possible crash at plugin shutdown
- Fix parsing SIP provider names

2011-01-22: Version 1.3.7
- changes in libfritz++
  * Add Config::Shutdown() to gracefully shutdown the library
    This can be used for re-inits as well as on program exit
